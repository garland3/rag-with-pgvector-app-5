Sample Document for Testing

This is a sample document used for testing the RAG ingestion pipeline.

The document contains multiple paragraphs to test text chunking functionality.
Each paragraph should be properly processed and converted into embeddings.

Key concepts covered:
- Natural language processing
- Information retrieval
- Vector databases
- Machine learning applications

This document helps verify that the system can:
1. Extract text from plain text files
2. Split text into appropriate chunks
3. Generate embeddings for each chunk
4. Store the results in the database

Testing is crucial for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the RAG system.
The ingestion pipeline must handle various document formats and sizes efficiently.
